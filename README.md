Web3 Media Player

The goal is to create a Web3 native media player that allows NFT collectors and creators to easily access and enjoy their NFTs, and functions like a traditional media player. This will improve the organization and user experience of NFTs, as currently NFTs can only be played on specific marketplaces and switching pages stops the playback.

A good example was the HIC.AF player (old) but they changed it to a lower level version now for no reason. The ideal scenario allows you to create playlists, pause, skip, shuffle on the go, even if you're browsing the marketplace and even move to different pages.

Any tuning, feedback, or help is more than welcome and highly appreciated. <3
